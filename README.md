<h1>Plant life cycle</h1>

<p>The plant life cycle is the <i>cyclic process of reproduction</i> from the beginning of <a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wm-biology2/chapter/plant-life-spans/#:~:text=The%20length%20of%20time%20from,production%20of%20the%20mature%20plant.">plant life</a> to the return to the starting state. The process involves a series of changes in form and includes <b>germination, growth, asexual reproduction, and/or sexual reproduction.[1]</b></p>

    <h1>Galaxies Copyright goes to Creator<sup><span>&#169;</span></sup></h1>

    <h2>Explanation:</h2> 
    <p>Galaxies are sprawling systems of dust, gas, dark matter, and anywhere from a million to a trillion stars that are held together by gravity. Nearly all large galaxies are thought to also contain supermassive black holes at their centers. In our own galaxy, the Milky Way, the sun is just one of about 100 to 400 billion stars that spin around Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole that contains as much mass as four million suns.</p>
    <p>The deeper we look into the cosmos, the more galaxies we see. One 2016 study estimated that the observable universe contains two trillion—or two million million—galaxies. Some of those distant systems are similar to our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way">Milky Way galaxy</a>, while others are quite different.</p>

    <h2>Types of galaxy</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spiral galaxies - A spiral galaxy has a flat, <i>spinning disk with a central bulge surrounded by spiral arms <span>&uarr;</span></i> </li>
        <li>Elliptical galaxies - They are generally round but can stretch longer along one axis than along the other, so much so that some take on a cigar-like appearance <span>&#9829;</span></li>
        <li>Lenticular galaxies - They're called “lenticular” because they resemble lenses: Like spiral galaxies, they have a thin, rotating disk of stars and a central bulge, but they don't have spiral arms </li>
